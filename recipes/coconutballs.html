    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>It is one of the first things children learn to make, and it's enjoyed greatly by all ages. The balls can either be bite-sized or giant, whichever seems more appealing. Or make one big ball, and many small ones. Additional cocoa powder or chocolate can be added to intensify the flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups regular rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 cup butter or margarine, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons strong coffee</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened baking chocolate, melted</li>
        <li>⅓ cup coconut flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix the oats, sugar, and cocoa together in a bowl. Add the butter, and use your hands to mix the ingredients together to make a thick dough. Mix in the coffee, vanilla, and chocolate until thoroughly blended.</li>
        <li>Place the coconut flakes in a small bowl. Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll between your hands to make small balls, about 1-1/2 inches in diameter. Roll the balls in the coconut flakes. Balls are ready to eat, or may be refrigerated 2 hours to become firmer.</li>
    </ol>
